# FizzBuzzGame_FSharp
An example of the FizzBuzz game written using F#.

This was one of my first attempts to use F#.

I have done some comparisons of performance between the C# version and this F# version.

I found that the C# version was faster, although, not by much.  The bonus of F#, is the amount of code written.

I am looking at doing different things with F#, so see if I can find out what code or patterns that can be used to show F# is faster than C#.
